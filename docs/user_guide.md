![Dashboard Overview](images/dashboard.png)

## Creating a New Study

1. From your dashboard, click the "Create New Study" button
2. Select the type of study you want to design:
   - Randomized Controlled Trial
   - Diagnostic Accuracy Study
   - Cohort Study

![Study Type Selection](images/study_type.png)

> **Why this matters:** Different study types require different design approaches and statistical methods. Selecting the appropriate type ensures you receive relevant guidance throughout the process.

## Study Design Wizard

The Study Design Wizard guides you through the process of designing your study step by step.

### Step 1: Research Question

Define your research question using the structured format:

- For RCTs: Intervention, Comparator, Population, Outcome
- For Diagnostic Studies: Index Test, Reference Standard, Target Condition, Population
- For Cohort Studies: Exposure, Outcome, Population, Timeframe

![Research Question Screen](images/research_question.png)

> **Why this matters:** A well-defined research question is the foundation of a good study. The structured format ensures all critical elements are included.

### Step 2: Variable Definition

Define the variables you'll measure in your study:

1. Click "Add Variable" to create a new variable
2. Enter the variable name (e.g., "Systolic Blood Pressure")
3. Select the variable type (Continuous, Categorical, Binary, Time)
4. Assign a role (Primary Outcome, Secondary Outcome, Covariate, etc.)
5. Add any constraints or units if applicable

![Variable Definition Screen](images/variable_definition.png)

> **Why this matters:** Clearly defined variables are essential for proper statistical analysis. The type and role of each variable determine which statistical tests are appropriate.

## Statistical Test Selection

Based on your study design and variables, Stat-Assist will recommend appropriate statistical tests.

1. Review the recommended primary test and alternatives
2. Read the plain-language explanation of why this test is recommended
3. See the assumptions that need to be met for the test to be valid
4. Select your preferred test from the recommendations

![Statistical Test Screen](images/statistical_test.png)

> **Why this matters:** Choosing the right statistical test is critical for valid results. Our recommendations are based on established statistical principles and best practices in clinical research.

## Power Calculation

Determine the sample size needed for your study:

1. Enter your expected effect size (or use our guidance to estimate it)
2. Set your desired significance level (alpha, typically 0.05)
3. Set your desired power (typically 0.8 or 0.9)
4. View the calculated sample size and power curve
5. Adjust parameters to see how they affect your required sample size

![Power Calculation Screen](images/power_calculation.png)

> **Why this matters:** An adequately powered study is essential for detecting true effects. Too few participants wastes resources on a study unlikely to find significant results, while too many unnecessarily exposes more participants to potential risks.

## Protocol Generation

Generate a study protocol based on your design:

1. Review the protocol summary
2. Customize sections as needed
3. Add additional details specific to your study
4. Export the protocol as Word or PDF
5. Share with collaborators for review

![Protocol Generation Screen](images/protocol.png)

> **Why this matters:** A comprehensive protocol ensures all team members understand the study procedures and helps with regulatory submissions and ethics approvals.

## Managing Your Studies
