# Stat-Assist Quick-Start Tutorial Video Script

## Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**[SCENE: Clean, professional opening with Stat-Assist logo]**

**NARRATOR:** Welcome to Stat-Assist, the platform designed to make clinical research design, analysis, and reporting more accessible and efficient. In this quick-start tutorial, we'll walk you through creating your first study, from initial concept to a complete study protocol.

> **Why this matters:** Clinical research is essential for advancing medical knowledge, but the statistical aspects can be challenging. Stat-Assist bridges this gap by providing guided workflows and automated statistical recommendations.

## Account Setup (0:30 - 1:00)

**[SCENE: Screen recording of account creation process]**

**NARRATOR:** Let's start by creating your account. Navigate to app.statassist.com and click "Sign Up" in the top-right corner. Fill in your details, including your name, email, and password. Select your role—clinician, researcher, or statistician—and click "Create Account."

**[SCENE: Show email verification screen]**

**NARRATOR:** You'll receive a verification email. Click the link to verify your account, then complete your profile with your research interests and specialties. This helps us customize the platform to your specific needs.

## Dashboard Overview (1:00 - 1:30)

**[SCENE: Screen recording of dashboard]**

**NARRATOR:** After logging in, you'll see your dashboard. This is your command center for all research activities. Here you can see your studies, quick actions, recent activity, and educational resources.

**[SCENE: Highlight the "Create New Study" button]**

**NARRATOR:** To start your first study, click the "Create New Study" button in the top-right corner.

## Creating a New Study (1:30 - 2:15)

**[SCENE: Screen recording of study type selection]**

**NARRATOR:** First, select the type of study you want to design. For this tutorial, we'll create a Randomized Controlled Trial or RCT. Click on the RCT card and then "Continue to Design."

**[SCENE: Show study creation confirmation]**

**NARRATOR:** Stat-Assist has now created your study and will guide you through the design process step by step. Notice the progress bar at the top showing the five main steps: Research Question, Variables, Statistical Test, Power Calculation, and Review.

## Defining Your Research Question (2:15 - 3:00)

**[SCENE: Screen recording of research question form]**

**NARRATOR:** The first step is defining your research question. For an RCT, you'll need to specify:

- The intervention you're testing, such as "Daily aspirin 81mg"
- The comparator, such as "Placebo"
- The population, such as "Adults with cardiovascular risk factors"
- The outcome, such as "Incidence of cardiovascular events"

**[SCENE: Show completed form and click "Continue"]**

**NARRATOR:** This structured format ensures your research question includes all critical elements. Once complete, click "Continue" to move to the next step.

## Defining Variables (3:00 - 4:00)

**[SCENE: Screen recording of variable definition]**

**NARRATOR:** Now we'll define the variables for our study. Click "Add Variable" to create your first variable.

**[SCENE: Show filling out variable form]**

**NARRATOR:** Let's add "Cardiovascular Events" as our primary outcome:
- Name: "Cardiovascular Events"
- Type: "Binary" (since either an event occurs or it doesn't)
- Role: "Primary Outcome"

**[SCENE: Add a second variable]**

**NARRATOR:** Now let's add a covariate:
- Name: "Age"
- Type: "Continuous"
- Role: "Covariate"
- Units: "years"

**[SCENE: Click "Continue"]**

**NARRATOR:** You can add as many variables as needed for your study. When finished, click "Continue" to move to the statistical test selection.

## Statistical Test Selection (4:00 - 4:45)

**[SCENE: Screen recording of statistical test recommendation]**

**NARRATOR:** Based on your study design and variables, Stat-Assist recommends appropriate statistical tests. For our example with a binary primary outcome in an RCT, the system recommends a Chi-square test.

**[SCENE: Highlight explanation section]**

**NARRATOR:** Notice the plain-language explanation of why this test is recommended and the assumptions that need to be met. Alternative tests are also suggested if your data doesn't meet these assumptions.

**[SCENE: Select recommended test and click "Continue"]**

**NARRATOR:** After reviewing the recommendations, select the test you want to use and click "Continue" to move to the power calculation step.

## Power Calculation (4:45 - 5:45)

**[SCENE: Screen recording of power calculation form]**

**NARRATOR:** Now we'll determine the sample size needed for your study. For our Chi-square test, we need to specify:

- The expected effect size (we'll use 0.3 for a medium effect)
- The significance level (typically 0.05)
- The desired power (typically 0.8 or 0.9)

**[SCENE: Show power curve graph]**

**NARRATOR:** Stat-Assist calculates the required sample size and displays a power curve showing how power increases with sample size. For our example, we need approximately 88 participants to achieve 80% power.

**[SCENE: Adjust parameters to show impact]**

**NARRATOR:** You can adjust these parameters to see how they affect your required sample size. For example, if we increase our desired power to 90%, notice how the required sample size increases to 117.

**[SCENE: Click "Continue"]**

**NARRATOR:** Once you're satisfied with your power calculation, click "Continue" to move to the final review step.

## Protocol Generation and Review (5:45 - 6:30)

**[SCENE: Screen recording of protocol summary]**

**NARRATOR:** The final step is reviewing your study design and generating a protocol. Stat-Assist summarizes all the information you've entered and creates a draft protocol document.

**[SCENE: Show protocol sections]**

**NARRATOR:** The protocol includes standard sections like Introduction, Methods, Statistical Analysis Plan, and Ethics Considerations. You can edit any section by clicking on it.

**[SCENE: Show export options]**

**NARRATOR:** When you're ready, you can export the protocol as a Word document or PDF by clicking "Export" in the top-right corner. You can also share it with collaborators directly from this screen.

## Saving and Sharing (6:30 - 7:00)

**[SCENE: Screen recording of save and share options]**

**NARRATOR:** Your study is automatically saved as you work. To share it with colleagues, click the "Share" button and enter their email addresses. You can set permission levels for each collaborator—View, Edit, or Admin.

**[SCENE: Show dashboard with completed study]**

**NARRATOR:** You can access your study at any time from your dashboard. Simply click on the study title to continue working on it.

## Conclusion (7:00 - 7:30)

**[SCENE: Return to dashboard with multiple studies]**
